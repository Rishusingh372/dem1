Internship – Day 1
Task 1 – Personal Portfolio Website
 I created a new GitHub repository named portfolio with a README file, set up Git locally, added index.html and README.md, committed and pushed changes, and verified successful hosting on GitHub.
Task 2 – Branching and Pull Request
 I created a new branch named portfolio from main, updated the email in index.html, committed and pushed changes, raised a Pull Request (PR), merged it into main, and deleted the branch.

Task 3 – Organization Repository
 I created a GitHub Organization, invited a member with repository access, created a new repository inside the organization, and successfully pushed my personal portfolio project into it for collaborative use.

Task 5 – Fork Repository
 I forked a repository, cloned it locally, made changes on a new branch, pushed it, and created a pull request which the owner reviewed and accepted.

Task 6 – Collaborator Access
 I added a collaborator through GitHub settings, invited them via username, and verified their access as they successfully cloned, edited, committed, and pushed changes to the shared repository.

Task 8 – Collaborator Contribution and Pull Request
 I added a friend as a collaborator, they created a new branch, developed a feature, raised a pull request, and I reviewed and merged it into the main branch successfully.
